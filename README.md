# MoodFM - Your feelings, your music 🎵
MoodFM is an AI-powered music recommender that transforms your emotions into the perfect song. Just type how you feel (in any language), and MoodFM analyzes your mood using natural language processing and finds a song that matches your emotional state.

## How To Use 📚

- Let the AI analyse your mood and find the perfect song !

## How It Works 🛠️
Enter how you feel and MoodFM translates your mood using Google Translate API, analyzes it with AI (Huggingface models), matches it to curated music tags, fetches tracks from Last.fm and major platforms, and lets you share your personalized song with a unique link—all powered by a privacy-friendly Flask backend and a Vanila JS frontend.

#### Enjoy your summer !☀️
