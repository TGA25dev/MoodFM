# MoodFM - Your feelings, your music üéµ
MoodFM is an AI-powered music recommender that transforms your emotions into the perfect song. Just type how you feel (in any language), and MoodFM analyzes your mood using natural language processing and finds a song that matches your emotional state.

## How To Use üìö
- Go to [https://moodfm.pronotif.tech](https://moodfm.promotif.tech)
- Explain how you feel in the searchbar (See examples on the website)
- Let the AI analyse your mood and find the perfect song
- Share the song with your friends and vibe together !

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è
Enter how you feel and MoodFM translates your mood using Google Translate API, analyzes it with AI (Huggingface models), matches it to curated music tags, fetches tracks from Last.fm and major platforms, and lets you share your personalized song with a unique link‚Äîall powered by a privacy-friendly Flask backend and a Vanila JS frontend.

## Why Was It Made ?
That project is my submission to the Summer of Making 2025 organized by Hackclub, the goal is to create a fun and usefull project to get votes and win cool stuff.

#### Enjoy your summer !‚òÄÔ∏è
